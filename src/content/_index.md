# eBPF for Everyone

## Runtime security for containers

InGRAINd helps you gather runtime security metrics from your
Linux machines without modifying a single line of code.

Make fine-grained rules about what your containerized services can or
can't do, and take immediate action.

Write your own modules for better observability using a cutting edge
Rust-based toolchain that's easy to use and blazing fast.

## Secure & Safe

Both eBPF and Rust are designed for safe execution and protection
against memory corruption vulnerabilities. With InGRAIN even _you_ can
write safe and secure modules that will never ruin your system.

<--->

## Customize as you Wish

Instead of treating the core of the system as black magic, InGRAINd
provides easy to understand documentation for a variety of eBPF
functionality, so you can extend and improve the data you rely on.

<--->

## Designed for Real Life

Because your time is your most expensive asset, we designed InGRAINd
to make deployment easy and frictionless for monitoring VMs and
containers. Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, Arm64, choose your own buzzword.
