# eBPF for Everyone

## Runtime security for containers

`ingraind` gathers runtime security metrics from your Linux machines
without you having to modify a single line of code.

Set fine-grained rules about what your containerized services can or
can't do, and how to react when the rules are broken.

Write your own modules for better observability using our cutting edge
Rust-based toolchain that's easy to use and blazing fast.

## Safe & Secure

Both eBPF and Rust are designed for safe execution and protection
against memory corruption vulnerabilities. With `ingraind` making both
easy to use, even _you_ can write safe and secure modules that will
never ruin your system.

<--->

## Customize as you Wish

Instead of treating the core of the system as a black box, `ingraind`
provides easy to follow documentation for a variety of eBPF
functionality, so you can extend and enhance the data you rely on.

<--->

## Designed for Real Life

Because your time is your most expensive asset, we designed InGRAINd
to make deployment easy and frictionless for monitoring VMs and
containers. Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, Arm64, bring your own buzzword.
